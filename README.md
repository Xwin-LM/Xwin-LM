**Step up your LLM alignment with Xwin-LM!**

Xwin-LM aims to develop and open-source alignment technologies for large language models, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward models (RM), reject sampling, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), etc. Our first release, built-upon on the Llama2 base models, ranked **TOP-1** on [AlpacaEval](https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval/). Notably, it's **the first to surpass GPT-4** on this benchmark. The project will be continuously updated.

|I've put a plate on top of an apple, and take the plate from kitchen to dining room. Where is the apple now|The apple is now in the dining room, as it was underneath the plate when you moved the plate from the kitchen to the dining room.|The apple is still in the kitchen, as you have only moved the plate. The apple is under the plate, so if you want to bring the apple to the dining room, you should either move the apple directly or put the apple on the plate and then move the plate to the dining room.|
| Answer the following question.<br> How do you say "good evening" in French. | In French, "good evening" is said as "bonsoir." | In French, "good evening" is translated to "bonsoir." This greeting is used in the evening and nighttime hours, typically after 6 p.m. It is a combination of "bon," which means "good," and "soir," which means "evening." To pronounce it, say "bone-swahr." |

## Inference

### Conversation Template
To obtain desired results, please strictly follow the conversation templates when utilizing our model for inference. Our model adopts the prompt format established by [Vicuna](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat) and is equipped to support **multi-turn** conversations.
```
A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: Hi! ASSISTANT: Hello.</s>USER: Who are you? ASSISTANT: I am Xwin-LM.</s>......
```

### HuggingFace Example

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("Xwin-LM/Xwin-LM-7B-V0.1")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Xwin-LM/Xwin-LM-7B-V0.1")
(
    prompt := "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. "
            "The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. "
            "USER: Hello, can you help me? "
            "ASSISTANT:"
)
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
samples = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=4096, temperature=0.7)
output = tokenizer.decode(samples[0][inputs["input_ids"].shape[1]:], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(output) 
# Of course! I'm here to help. Please feel free to ask your question or describe the issue you're having, and I'll do my best to assist you.
```


### vLLM Example
Because Xwin-LM is based on Llama2, it also offers support for rapid inference using [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm). Please refer to [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) for detailed installation instructions.
```python
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams
(
    prompt := "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. "
            "The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. "
            "USER: Hello, can you help me? "
            "ASSISTANT:"
)
sampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0.7, max_tokens=4096)
llm = LLM(model="Xwin-LM/Xwin-LM-7B-V0.1")
outputs = llm.generate([prompt,], sampling_params)

for output in outputs:
    prompt = output.prompt
    generated_text = output.outputs[0].text
    print(generated_text)
```

## TODO

- [ ] Release the source code
